# Assisted-Living-Facility-Market-Mapping

**Purpose:** Specrtum Health reached out to me looking for area data on current accredited Assisted Living Facilities. They were trying to decide where to set up their home office and did not want to choose a market/county that was already oversaturated.

**Question:** What areas in Pringe George's County are currently oversaturated with Assisted Living Businesses?

**Results:** Through area mapping, I discovered that areas located in central Prince George's County are more saturated than areas in northern or southern Prince George's County. My recommendation to my client was to look at buying business property in the Waldorf/Upper Marlboro areas OR the Laurel/Calverton area.

**Included Files:**

- Tableau workbook including visualizaion
- Assisted Living Program Excel
